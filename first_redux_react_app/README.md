This is the first react redux project created by Amy Wang. In this app, you can search food(i.e. orange, chicken) that you want, and then you can add it to cart. Of course, you can check your cart and click button to increase or decrease the quantity of the food.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
